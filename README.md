## Introduction

Welcome to the **Secure Raspberry Pi Credit Card Reader Integration** project! This project demonstrates how to securely connect a credit card reader to a Raspberry Pi, enabling integration into a self-contained banking system. Emphasizing robust security measures and compliance with industry standards, this setup is ideal for developers aiming to build secure financial applications.

## Features

- **Secure Communication:** Utilizes encrypted serial communication with the credit card reader.
- **Data Encryption & Tokenization:** Implements AES-256 encryption and tokenization to protect sensitive card data.
- **Secure API Integration:** Connects with secure banking APIs for transaction processing.
- **Flask Web Interface:** Provides a secure web interface with HTTPS and JWT-based authentication.
- **Robust Logging:** Implements secure logging without exposing sensitive information.
- **Compliance Ready:** Designed with PCI DSS standards in mind.

The system architecture comprises the following components:

1. **Credit Card Reader:** Connected via USB to the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Raspberry Pi:** Acts as the central hub, handling data encryption, storage, and API communication.
3. **Database:** Securely stores encrypted transaction data.
4. **Flask Web Server:** Provides API endpoints for reading card data and retrieving transactions.
5. **Security Modules:** Ensure data encryption, secure key management, and authentication.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
- **Raspberry Pi 4** (or any model with USB ports)
- **USB Credit Card Reader** (e.g., EMV Chip Reader with Serial Interface)
- **MicroSD Card** (16GB or higher) with Raspberry Pi OS installed
- **Power Supply** for Raspberry Pi
- **Secure Element Module** (optional but recommended for key storage)

### Software
- **Raspberry Pi OS** (latest version)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Docker** (optional for containerization)
- **SSL Certificates** (for HTTPS)

## Hardware Setup

1. **Power Off the Raspberry Pi:**
   Ensure the Pi is powered off before connecting any peripherals.

2. **Connect the Credit Card Reader:**
   Plug the USB credit card reader into one of the Raspberry Piâ€™s USB ports.
